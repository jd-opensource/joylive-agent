/**
 * Defines a plugin's configuration including its matching criteria and interceptors.
 * This interface is intended to be implemented by plugins to specify how they should
 * be applied to target classes and which interceptors should be used.
 * <p>
 * The plugin system may use the {@link #getMatcher()} method to determine if a plugin
 * should be applied to a given class based on its characteristics.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #getInterceptors()} method provides the interceptor definitions that should
 * be used to modify or extend the behavior of the matched classes.
 * <p>
 * The order constants (e.g., {@link #ORDER_SYSTEM}, {@link #ORDER_APPLICATION}, etc.)
 * define the precedence of plugin application, allowing for a structured layering
 * of plugins based on their purpose and dependencies.
 * <p>
 * This interface is marked as {@code @Extensible("PluginDefinition")} to indicate
 * that it is intended for extension by plugin developers.
