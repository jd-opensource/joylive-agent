/**
 * A {@code ClusterInvoker} that implements the fail-fast cluster invocation strategy.
 * <p>
 * When using the fail-fast strategy, the invoker will attempt to execute an invocation only once.
 * If the invocation fails due to a network error, a service error, or any other kind of
 * exceptional condition, it will not attempt to retry or reroute the invocation to another node.
 * Instead, it will fail immediately and return the exception.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This strategy is typically used when it is preferable to fail an operation and handle the
 * exception immediately rather than waiting for retries that may ultimately still fail. It reduces
 * the impact on system resources and operation time when a failure is likely unrecoverable.
 * </p>
