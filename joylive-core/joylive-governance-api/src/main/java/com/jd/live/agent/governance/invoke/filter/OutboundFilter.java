/**
 * Defines an interface for outbound filters that handle outbound requests.
 * <p>
 * This interface specifies how outbound requests should be handled by defining a {@code filter} method. Implementations
 * of this interface can perform operations on the outbound requests and decide whether to pass the request to the next
 * filter in the chain or to terminate the processing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Filters can be executed in a specified order, which is indicated by the constants {@code ORDER_OUTBOUND_*}. This allows
 * for a structured and predictable processing of outbound requests.
