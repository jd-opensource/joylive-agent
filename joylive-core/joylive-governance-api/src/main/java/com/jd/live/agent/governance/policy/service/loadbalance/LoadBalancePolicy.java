/**
 * Represents a policy for load balancing that dictates how tasks or requests are distributed
 * among various resources or services. This class encapsulates the settings and strategies
 * used to balance load, aiming to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response
 * time, and avoid overloading any single resource.
 * <p>
 * The {@code LoadBalancePolicy} class implements {@link PolicyInheritWithId} interface, enabling
 * policy inheritance. This allows a load balance policy to supplement its configuration from another
 * policy of the same type. This feature is particularly useful for dynamically adjusting load balancing
 * strategies in response to changing operational conditions or requirements.
 * </p>
 *
 * Instances of this class can be identified by a unique ID and categorized by a policy type, which
 * describes the load balancing strategy (e.g., round-robin, least connections, hash-based) being applied.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
